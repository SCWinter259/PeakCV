# About

PeakCV is an AI resume improvement tool built with **TypeScript**, **React**, **TailwindCSS**, **Express**, and **Node**. The AI component is powered by **Gemini API**. The app allows software engineers to tailor their resume to the job application, using a standardized format. In the process, the user can choose which suggestion to implement, as well as make customisations to their new resume by editing the generated LaTeX code.

The backend is containerised with **Docker** and then hosted on **Azure**, and the frontend is hosted on Vercel.
